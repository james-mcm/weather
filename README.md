# Responsive 5-day Weather Forecast

This is a weather forecast reponsive project that gets weather data from the [OpenWeatherMap Api](https://openweathermap.org/forecast5). The challenge was to create a single responsive single HTML page displaying a 5 day weather forecast.

## Running the project

To work on the build I have used Brackets.io, you can download it [here](http://brackets.io/).

To run the project locally you can simply drag and drop the unzipped folder in Brackets, select landing-api.html and click on the live preview mode - the lightning icon at the top right.

There are two html files : landing.html and landing-api.html. The first does not use any api data, it is mainly to showcase a variety of icons / svg animation.

## General notes

I have decided to use London as the forecast location due to the relevance of the location for this project.

I have decided to focus on displaying the weather data as the current time and weather data at the same time of the day for the next 4 days. 

Being not a javascript expert, my main focus here was to create a desirable UI and show some general technical understanding of how to manipulate API data.

## What I would do with more time

* The background image has a subtle animation that mimics a wind effect, adding a "weathery" feel to the page. The background animation is best viewed on mobile or smaller screens, with more time I'd make it more obvious on larger screens.

* Create a variety of  backgrounds that match the current weather.

* Enable the user to switch to a more detailed view showing weather data for each day at a 3h interval (mocked up in the XD file)

* I wasn't sure about the importance of night time temperatures, maybe these could be filtered out

* Finalise icon set as I prioritised the most relevant weather conditions in London (rain, clouds etc) and gather icons in a web font
